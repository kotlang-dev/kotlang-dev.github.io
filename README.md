# **My Personal Portfolio Website (Archived)**

**‚ö†Ô∏è This project has been archived.**

This portfolio was built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It has been superseded by a new, more advanced version built entirely in Kotlin using the Kobweb framework.

### **Please visit the new portfolio:**

* **New Source Code:** [**github.com/kotlang-dev/PortfolioWebsite**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/kotlang-dev/PortfolioWebsite)

This repository contains the complete source code for my first personal portfolio website.

This project was built from scratch to showcase my skills not only in Android development but also in modern front-end web development. It served as a central hub for my projects, skills, and contact information before being replaced by the new Kotlin-based version.

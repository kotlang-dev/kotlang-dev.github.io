This repository contains the complete source code for my personal portfolio website, which is live at **[kotlang-dev.github.io](https://kotlang-dev.github.io)**.

This project was built from scratch to showcase my skills not only in Android development but also in modern front-end web development. It serves as a central hub for my projects, skills, and contact information.
